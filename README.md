# MachineLearning

A paper on Big Data analytics, systems, and machine learning is included with source code. 

This was a learning process in order to gain experiene with Spark & Scala, R & Hadoop, Spark & R, Matlab, and R in general.
The first step was to characterize the data, create .csv files, then setup a big data system and run machine learning algorithms over 
the data previously chararized.
